<p> Hello everyone, I am Isaiah Islam.
  Hmmm, I am not exactly sure what to put here so let's ramble a little bit shall we...?
  <br>
  <br>
  As mentioned before, my name is Isaiah Islam. I was born in July of 1997 and I was raised in my home town of Brooklyn, New York. Although I was born in the summer, I don't really like the summer weather (I don't enjoy the heat at all really... I'm more of a winter guy). I always had an interest in technology ever since I was young but I never received any type of formal training. I enjoy seeking challenges and improving different aspects of myself every day.
</p>

<p> In my free time I love watching anime and playing video games with friends, although I am not opposed to just relaxing and listening to music. My favorite game is any game in the Devil May Cry series, I grew up with that game and it will always hold a special in my heart. Moving on, my favorite anime is Inuyasha. Talking about recent anime with my friends is always an experience I can appreciate. When I was in high school I used to play the bass with some friends. Although I fell out of practice I wouldn't mind picking it back up.
